# Objects for Review Plugin 3.0


## About
This plugins builds on the idea of the OFR and BFR plugins for OJS 2.x to provide support for reviews of books and other material being published on OJS and OMP.

User stories to be covered as basic functionality:

- As an author, submit metadata of the reviewed object together with the review's manuscript.
- A a reader, see metadata of the reviewed object on the article landing page in dedicated areas and have a link to access the digital version of the reviewed object (if available).

The frontend object listing uses https://github.com/tristen/tablesort for table sorting.
